### Description:

A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate weather the insurace will be claimed or not.
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is slightly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

**This data frame contains the following columns:**

* age : age of policyholder
* sex: gender of policy holder (female=0, male=1)
* bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 25
* steps: average walking steps per day of policyholder
* children: number of children / dependents of policyholder
* smoker: smoking state of policyholder (non-smoke=0;smoker=1)
* region: the residential area of policyholder in the US (northeast=0, northwest=1, southeast=2, southwest=3)
* charges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance
* insuranceclaim: yes=1, no=0

This is "Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset" which based on "[Medical Cost Personal Datasets][1]" to update sample value on top.
